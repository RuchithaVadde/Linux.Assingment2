we use the following command to swap the 2nd and 3rd columns of a file, remove duplicate rows, add line counts and save output to a new file.

awk '{ temp = $2; $2 = $3; $3 = temp } 1' <input_file> | sort -u | tee >(echo -e "Total no lines before: $(wc -l <input_file)\nTotal no lines after: $(wc -l)") >Demo2.txt

we use the following command to swap the 2nd and 3rd columns of a file, remove duplicate rows, add line counts and save output to a new file.

'awk '{ temp = $2; $2 = $3; $3 = temp } 1': This swaps the 2nd and 3rd columns of each line of the input file. The 1 at the end tells awk to print each line after processing it.

'sort -u': This sorts the output and removes duplicated lines.
